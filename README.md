# Rider-Driven-Cancellation-Prediction
Predicting Rider-Driven Cancellation(i.e before the order is marked delivered/cancelled) for food delivery.

Typical Flow of order
A client creates the order in the system

The order gets allocated to a rider
The rider accepts the order
The rider goes to the pickup location
The rider picks up the order
The rider goes to the delivery location and delivers the order
The rider also has the option to get the order cancelled before delivery by calling the clientâ€™s call centre. We would like to predict this kind of cancellation before it happens so that we can try and reassign the order to another rider before it gets cancelled.
